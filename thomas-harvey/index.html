	<p>
	Tom attended St Joseph's University where he studied Economics. He became
	a programmer because he loves solving problems.
	</p>
	<p>
	He's a fierce proponent of object-oriented programming and flexible,
	extensible solutions.
	</p>
	<p>Tom convinced our staff and many students to compete with each other in
	<a href="http://www.codewars.com">Code Wars</a>
	and he does interview prep and whiteboarding with our graduates
	twice a week.
