	<p>
	Jason studied Marketing as an undergraduate at CUNY Baruch, and then got his
	Master's degree in Higher Education Administration.
	</p>
	<p>
	He's obsessed with JavaScript and every flavor-of-the-month library, as well
	as the flavor of last month and the flavor of next month. He is our
	resident front-end specialist.
	</p>
	<p>
	Jason managed a revamp of our curriculum and he writes code while standing up.
