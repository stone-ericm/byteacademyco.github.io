	<p>
	After graduating from Columbia University in 2006, Cody pursued a
	career as a performer for ten years. Ultimately unsuccessful,
	he returned to his first love: programming.
	</p>
	<p>
	He learned Java in college, but his first self-taught language was
	<a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>.
	He loves
	<a href="http://vim.org">Vim</a>
	and the command line. Lately he enjoys working
	with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end.
	</p>
	<p>
	Cody is the lead developer of
	<a href="http://bytedev.co">Byte Dev</a>,
	Byte Academy's online learning platform.
