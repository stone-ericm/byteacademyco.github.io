	Billy is our lead instructor. He began his programming career as a
	teenager, administering a Counter-Strike server with
	<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>,
	and he's been learning ever since.
	</p>
	<p>
	He's a
	<a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>
   	aficionado and a DevOps guru.
	</p>
	<p>
	Billy insists that our curriculum emphasize the fundamentals of Computer
	Science, especially data structures and algorithms, and include challenging
	exercises, such as building your own
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>
	and your own version of
	<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
	Together with

	he wrote the majority of the
	<a href="http://bytedev.co">Byte Dev</a>
